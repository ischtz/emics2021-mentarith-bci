We report here that pupil size measured by a bedside camera can be used to communicate with patients with locked-in syndrome. With the same protocol we demonstrate command-following for a patient in a minimally conscious state, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic tool for patients whose state of consciousness is in question. Importantly, neither training nor individual adjustment of our system's decoding parameters were required for successful decoding of patients' responses.},

  Abstract                 = {The prototype of a gaze-controlled, head-mounted camera (EyeSeeCam) was developed that provides the functionality for fundamental studies on human gaze behavior even under dynamic conditions like locomotion. EyeSeeCam incorporates active visual exploration by saccades with image stabilization during head, object, and surround motion just as occurs in human ocular motor control. This prototype is a first attempt to combine free user mobility with image stabilization and unrestricted exploration of the visual surround in a man-made technical vision system. The gaze-driven camera is supplemented by an additional wide-angle, head-fixed scene camera. In this scene view, the focused gaze view is embedded with picture-in-picture functionality, which provides an approximation of the foveated retinal content. Such a combined video clip can be viewed more comfortably than the saccade-pervaded image of the gaze camera alone. EyeSeeCam consists of a video-oculography (VOG) device and a camera motion device. The benchmark for the evaluation of such a device is the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which requires a latency on the order of 10 msec between head and eye (camera) movements for proper image stabilization. A new lightweight VOG was developed that is able to synchronously measure binocular eye positions at up to 600 Hz. The camera motion device consists of a parallel kinematics setup with a backlash-free gimbal joint that is driven by piezo actuators with no reduction gears. As a result, the latency between the rotations of an artificial eye and the camera was 10 msec, which is VOR-like.},

With the EyeSeeCam, we have recently presented a mobile eye-tracking device, whose camera-motion device (gazecam) records movies orientated in user's direction of gaze. Here we show that the EyeSeeCam can extract a reliable vergence signal, to measure the fixation distance. We extend the system to determine not only the direction of gaze for short distances more precisely, but also the fixation point in 3 dimensions (3D). Such information is vital, if gaze-tracking shall be combined with tasks requiring 3D information in the peri-personal space, such as grasping. Hence our method substantially extends the application range for mobile gaze-tracking devices and makes a decisive step towards their routine application in standardized clinical settings.},

  Abstract                 = {The muscles that control the pupil are richly innervated by the autonomic nervous system. While there are central pathways that drive pupil dilations in relation to arousal, there is no anatomical evidence that cortical centers involved with visual selective attention innervate the pupil. In this study, we show that such connections must exist. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel Pupil Frequency Tagging (PFT) method, where oscillatory changes in stimulus brightness over time are mirrored by pupil constrictions and dilations. We find that the luminance-induced pupil oscillations are enhanced when covert attention is directed to the flicker stimulus and when targets are correctly detected in an attentional tracking task. These results suggest that the amplitudes of pupil responses closely follow the allocation of focal visual attention and the encoding of stimuli. PFT provides a new opportunity to study top-down visual attention itself as well as identifying the pathways and mechanisms that support this unexpected phenomenon.},

  Abstract                 = {When the eyes are exposed to light, the pupils constrict. This is the well known pupillary light response. What is less well known is that the pupillary light response is not a simple reflex to light, but is modulated by visual attention: When you covertly attend to a bright stimulus, your pupil constricts relative to when you attend to a dark stimulus. Here we describe a human-computer interface that is based on this principle, i.e. decoding the focus of covert visual attention with pupillometry. Participants fixated in the center of a display, and selected (i.e. covertly attended to) one of several stimuli presented in a circular arrangement. Each stimulus was presented on a background with alternating brightness. Small changes in pupil size reflected the brightness alternations of the selected stimulus' background, and this allowed us to determine which stimulus was selected with nearly perfect accuracy on a trial-by-trial basis. An extension of this technique, in which the stimulus array serves as a virtual keyboard, even allows for arbitrary text input. As a human-computer interface, this technique has several key advantages: It is intuitive, because there is a direct mapping between the task (attending to a stimulus) and the goal (selecting a stimulus); It allows for bi-directional communication, because the analysis can be performed on-line; It is non-invasive and can be done with currently available low-cost eye trackers; It is reliable, i.e. decoding accuracy is nearly perfect under good conditions. We discuss potential applications, such as communication with locked-in patients and ultra-secure password input. Meeting abstract presented at VSS 2015.},

  abstract    = {We present a new human-computer interface that is based on decoding of attention through pupillometry. Our method builds on the recent finding that covert visual attention affects the pupillary light response: Your pupil constricts when you covertly (without looking at it) attend to a bright, compared to a dark, stimulus. In our method, participants covertly attend to one of several letters with oscillating brightness. Pupil size reflects the brightness of the selected letter, which allows us-with high accuracy and in real time-to determine which letter the participant intends to select. The performance of our method is comparable to the best covert-attention brain-computer interfaces to date, and has several advantages: no movement other than pupil-size change is required; no physical contact is required (i.e. no electrodes); it is easy to use; and it is reliable. Potential applications include: communication with totally locked-in patients, training of sustained attention, and ultra-secure password input.},
